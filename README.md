A collection of business data analyses using Python for data cleaning, exploration, and insight generation.
## Loan Default Probability Analysis

This project focuses on using data analytics and machine learning to assess the likelihood of loan default. The analysis supports better credit risk management by translating borrower and loan data into actionable insights for lending decisions.

---

## Business Context
Loan default poses a significant risk to financial institutions. Accurately predicting default probability enables lenders to:
- Improve credit approval decisions
- Reduce portfolio risk
- Optimize pricing and lending strategies
- Strengthen overall risk governance

This project demonstrates how data-driven models can be applied to support these objectives.

---

## Project Overview
The analysis follows a structured, end-to-end approach to credit risk modeling, including:
- Identifying relevant borrower and loan attributes
- Cleaning and refining data to improve reliability
- Evaluating multiple predictive models
- Selecting and tuning the most effective model
- Interpreting results to support business decisions

---

## Analytical Approach
The notebook includes the following key stages:

- **Data Preparation**
  - Target variable definition
  - Feature selection based on relevance, completeness, and correlation
- **Exploratory Analysis**
  - Assessment of borrower characteristics
  - Analysis of loan features influencing default risk
- **Model Development**
  - Comparison of multiple classification models
  - Handling class imbalance to reflect real-world lending scenarios
- **Model Optimization**
  - Hyperparameter tuning to improve predictive performance
- **Final Model Selection**
  - Evaluation using appropriate performance metrics
  - Review of key drivers influencing default probability

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- Data visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn)

---

## Data Notes
The dataset used reflects typical borrower and loan attributes required for credit risk analysis.  
Where original data cannot be shared due to confidentiality or size constraints, the methodology remains applicable to similar lending datasets.

---

## Business Value & Key Insights
- Demonstrates how analytics can improve loan risk assessment
- Highlights critical factors influencing default probability
- Provides a scalable framework for credit risk modeling
- Supports evidence-based decision-making in lending operations
